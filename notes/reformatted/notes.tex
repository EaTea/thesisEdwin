\section{Technical preliminaries}
In order to discuss event model synthesis, we first define essential concepts regarding event
models and the semantics of the logics we are working within.

\subsection{Models}

\begin{defn} \label{frame}
	Let $\Sigma$ be a set of atoms and $R: A \to \mathcal{P}(S \times S)$, a function from agents to
	accessibility relations.
	Then the tuple $(\Sigma, R)$ is a frame.
\end{defn}

A frame represents a mathematical structure, but holds no meaningful information.
In order to give meaning and be able to draw conclusions from the frame, we can
construct a valuation function that transforms the frame into a model detailing
information.
\begin{defn} \label{model}
	Let $L$ be a logical language.
	Let $F = (\Sigma, R)$ be a frame, and $A$ a set of agents.
	In the context of epistemic modal logic, $\Sigma$ is a set of atomic knowledge points.
	Let $V: L \to \mathcal{P}(\Sigma)$ be a function mapping any
	well-formed	sentence in $L$ to a subset of $\Sigma$.
	We say $V$ is a valuation function on $F$.\\
	\\
	Then $M = (F, V) = (\Sigma, R, V)$ is a Kripke
	model.
\end{defn}
A pointed model $M_s$ is a model $M = (\Sigma, R, V)$ along with a designated state $s \in S$.
A multi-pointed model is a model $M_T$ with a set of designated states, $T$.
We say $\kripkeClass$ is the class of all Kripke models.

\begin{defn} \label{evModel}
	Let $L$ be a logical language.
	Let $F = (\Sigma, R)$ be a frame, and $A$ a set of agents.
	An event model $M = (\Sigma, R, pre)$ with preconditions defined on $\mathcal{L}$ consists of
	\begin{itemize}
		\item a domain $\Sigma$ of possible atomic action points
		\item an accessibility function, $R: A \to \mathcal{P}(S \times S)$, a function from agents to
		accessibility relations on $\Sigma$.\\
		We refer to $R(a)$ as $R_a$.
		We will refer to all accessible action points from $s$ as $s R_a$, and all action points that
		can access $t$ as $R_a t$.
		Furthermore, we say $s R_a t$ means $t$ is $a$-accessible from $s$.
		\item a precondition function, $pre: \Sigma \to \mathcal{L}$ which maps an action point to a
		sentence in $\mathcal{L}$
	\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

Pointed and multi-pointed event models are similarly defined to pointed and multi-pointed Kripke
models.
We adopt the convention for pointed event models that $M^1 = \{\Sigma^1, R^1,
pre^1, T^1\}$ and $M^\alpha = \{\Sigma^\alpha,R^\alpha,pre^\alpha,T^\alpha\}$.

\begin{defn} \label{evModelEx}
Let $M = (\Sigma, R, V) \in L$. We define event model execution for an event model $N = (\Sigma^N,
		R^N, pre^N) \in
\mathcal{AM}$ as follows.
The result of executing $N$ on the model $M$ is denoted by $M \otimes N = M' = (\Sigma', R', V')$ where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\Sigma' = \{(s,u) | s \in \Sigma, u \in \Sigma^N \text{ such that } M_s \vdash pre^N(u)\}$
	\item $(s, u) R_a' (t, v) \iff s R_a t \land u R_a^N v$
	\item $V'((s,u)) = V(s)$
\end{itemize}
We define pointed event model execution as $M_s \otimes N_u = (M \otimes N)_{(s, u)}$.
This pointed model execution is only sensible if and only if $M_s \models pre^N(u)$ and thus $(s,u)
	\in \Sigma'$.
\end{defn}

We say $\eventClass$ is the class of all event models.

\begin{defn} \label{pub}
Let $M = (\{ \sigma \}, R, \{ (\sigma, \phi)\})$ be an event model.
Let $\sigma$ be a single action point and $R_a = \{(\sigma, \sigma)$ for each $a \in A$ and $\phi
\in \mathcal{L}$.
Then $M$ is a public announcement of $\phi$.
We say $\publicAnnClass$ is the class of all action models that
are public announcements of a sentence in $L$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn} \label{insanity}
Let $M = (\{ \sigma \}, \varnothing, \{(\sigma, \phi)\}) $ be an action model
where $\phi \in L$ and $\sigma$ is an action point.
$M$ represents the truthful announcement of $\phi$ causing all agents to renounce all their beliefs.
$\insaneClass = \{M | \phi \in L\}$ is the class of all such action models,
which we will term ``insanity models".
\end{defn}

\subsection{Bisimilarity, simulation and refinement}

\begin{defn} \label{bisim}
	Let $M$, $M'$ be Kripke models and $\sim \subseteq \Sigma \times \Sigma'$ be a non-empty binary
	relation.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\bf atoms}: for each $s \in \Sigma$ and $s' \in \Sigma'$ such that $s \sim s'$, $pre(s)
		\iff pre('s)$
		\item {\bf front-$a$}: for each $s \in \Sigma$ such that $s \sim s'$, for each $t$ such that
		$s R_a t$ then there exists $t'$ such that $s' R_a' t'$ and $t \sim t'$
		\item {\bf back-$a$}: for each $s' \in \Sigma'$ such that $s \sim s'$, for each $t$ such that
		$s' R_a' r'$ then there exists $t$ such that $s R_a t$ and $t \sim t'$
	\end{itemize}
	$\sim$ is a bisimulation between $M$ and $M'$ if and only if {\bf atoms} holds and {\bf front-$a$}
	and {\bf back-$a$} hold for each $a \in A$.
	We denote $M$ and $M'$ being bisimilar by $M \sim M'$.
\end{defn}
% FIXME: add in citations

\begin{lemma}
	The relation $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{defn} \label{refinement}
Let $B \subseteq A$ and $M$ and $M'$ be Kripke models. A non-empty relation $\lesssim \subseteq \Sigma
\times \Sigma'$ is a $B$-simulation if and only if it satisfies {\bf atoms}, {\bf forth-$a$} for
every $a \in A$ and {\bf back-$a$} for every $a \in A \setminus B$.
\end{defn}
If $(\sigma, \sigma') \in \lesssim$ then we say $M'_{\sigma'}$ is a $B$-simulation of $M_\sigma$ and
$M_\sigma$ a $B$-refinement of $M'_{\sigma'}$.
We write $M_{\sigma} \lesssim M'_{\sigma'}$ or equivalently $M'_{\sigma'} \gtrsim M_{\sigma}$.

\begin{defn} \label{brestrict}
Let $B \subseteq A$ and let $N \in \eventClass$. Then $N$ is a $B$-restricted event model if and
only if for every $u \in \Sigma$ and every $M_s \in \kripkeClass$ such that $M_s \models pre(u)$ we
have $M_s \otimes N_u \gtrsim_B M_s$.
We call the class of $B$-restricted action models $\mathcal{AM}_B$.
\end{defn}

\subsection{Language semantics}
We now discuss the semantics and syntax of several different languages, culminating with language of
arbitrary action model logic which will rely upon each of the languages we discuss.

\begin{defn} \label{modalLogic}
Let $M = (\Sigma, R, V) \in \kripkeClass$.
The language $\lang$ is inductively defined by
\[
	\phi ::== p | \neg \phi | (\phi \land \phi)
\]
The interpretation of $\phi \in \lang$ in the logic $K$ is defined inductively as
\begin{itemize}
	\item $M_s \models p$ iff $p \in V(s)$
	\item $M_s \models \neg \phi$ iff $M_s \not \models \phi$
	\item $M_s \models \phi \land \psi$ iff $M_s \models \phi$ and $M_s \models \psi$
	\item $M_s \models \Box_a \phi$ iff for every $t \in s R_a: M_t \models \phi$
	\item $M_s \models \Box_B \phi$ iff for every $b \in B : M_s \models \Box_b \phi$
\end{itemize}
for $a \in A$, $B \subseteq A$, $s \in \Sigma$.
\end{defn}
The Kripke semantics for modal logic are well-known.
We will adopt the standard abbreviations for Kripke semantics --- see FIXME.
%FIXME: Add in citations and stuff
In epistemic logics, the formula $\Box_a \phi$ is often read as ``$a$ knows/believes $\phi$", while
its dual, $\Diamond_a \phi$ means ``$a$ considers $\phi$ possible".
In the case where $B = A$ we write $M_s \models \Box \phi$.\\
\\
We say that a formula $\phi$ is satisfied by a pointed model Kripke model $M_s \in \kripkeClass$ iff
$M_s \models \phi$.
We say that $\phi$ is satisfied by a model $M = (\Sigma, R, V)$ (denoted by $M \models \phi$) iff
for all $\sigma \in \Sigma$, $M_\sigma \models \phi$.
Furthermore, $\phi$ is valid in a class of Kripke models $\kripkeClass$ iff for every model $M \in
\kripkeClass$, $M \models \phi$.\\
\\
%FIXME: Add citation
In addition to $Box_a$ we introduce the cover operator, as first defined in FIXME.
{\bf TODO: Add in citation to link to cover transformations. }

\begin{defn} \label{actModelLogic}
Let $M = (\Sigma, R, V) \in \kripkeClass$ be a Kripke model and $N = (\Sigma^N, R^N, pre^N) \in
\eventClass$ a multi-pointed event model.
The interpretation of $\phi \in \langActEx$ is the same as its interpretation in $\lang$
(\ref{modalLogic}), but with the additional
inductive cases
\begin{itemize}
	\item $M_s \models [ N_\sigma ] \phi$ iff $M_s \models \phi \implies M_s \otimes N_\sigma \models
	\phi$
	\item $M_s \models [ N_T ] \phi$ iff for every $\sigma \in T$, $M_s \models [ N_\sigma ] \phi$ 
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
$[ N_\sigma ] \phi$ can be read as ``the successful execution of the informative update modelled by
$N_\sigma$ will result in $\phi$ being true".
Similarly, $[ N_T ] \phi$ can be read as ``the successful execution of the informative update
modelled by $N_T$ will result in $\phi$ being true".
If $T = \Sigma^N$ then we write $M_s \models [ N ] \phi$.\\
\\
We adopt the standard convention for the dual operators, with $\langle N_\sigma \rangle \phi$ being
read as ``the successful execution of the informative update modelled by $N_\sigma$ may result in
$\phi$ being true".
Again, $\langle N_T \rangle \phi$ can be read as ``the successful execution of the informative
update modelled by $N_T$ may result in $\phi$ being true".

%FIXME: Add in citations to Baltag, Moss and Solecki

\begin{defn} \label{refineLogic}
Let $M = (\Sigma, R, V) \in \kripkeClass$ be a Kripke model.
The interpretation of $\phi \in \langRefine$ in the logic $K_\forall$ is the same as $\lang$
(\ref{modalLogic}), but with the additional inductive case
\[
	M_s \models \forall_B \phi \text{ iff } \forall M'_{s'} \in \eventClass \text{ such that } M'_{s'}
	\lesssim_B M_s : M'_{s'} \models \phi
\]
\end{defn}
We read the formula $\forall_B \phi$ as ``for any $B$-refinement, $\phi$ will hold".
Its dual, $\exists_B \phi$ can be read as ``there is a $B$-refinement such that $\phi$ will hold".
As in the previous operations, when $B = A$ we will write $\forall \phi$.
In addition, when $B = \{b\}$ we write $\forall_b$ and $\exists_b$.

%FIXME: Add in citations to Tim, Rowan, James

\begin{defn} \label{arbActLogic}
The language of arbitrary action model logic, $\langArbAct$ is first defined in FIXME.
We inductively define $\langArbAct$ by
\[
	\phi ::== p | \neg \phi | \phi \land \phi | \Box_a \phi | [ N_T ] \phi | \forall_B \phi
\]
for $N_T \in \eventClass$ and $B \subseteq A$.
\end{defn}
$\langArbAct$ is $\langActEx$ with $\forall_B$ and is also $\langRefine$ with $[ N_T ]$.

%FIXME: Add in the citations of James

\subsection{Axiomatisations}

TODO: Add in later, too lazy right now.

\section{Single-agent epistemic goal achievement in $\langArbAct$}

In this chapter, we examine an algebra for constructing event models that will, if possible, achieve
epistemic goals or cause a model to crash in the process.
Thus during our single agent treatment, we will say that $A = \{a\}$.\\
\\
%FIXME: citations here
In FIXME, Hales demonstrates that it is possible to determine whether an
finite epistemic goal can be achieved.
Furthermore, if it is achievable Hales constructs event models that will realise
that goal.
We will focus on defining a framework that constructs these event models in a
recursive manner.
This facilitates an automated method for updating knowledge models to reflect a
knowledge state.

\subsection{Technical preliminaries}

The event models that Hales employs resemble finite trees.
We give a rigourous definition for them as follows

\begin{defn} \label{finTree}
Let $M = (\Sigma, R, pre, r)$ be a pointed event model.
$M$ is a finite tree event model if
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\Sigma$, the set of action points is finite
	\item $r$ is the root of the tree and is not accessible from any other action point
	\item for each $s \in \Sigma \setminus \{ r \}$ there is a unique agent $a \in A$ and a unique
	action $p \in \Sigma$ such that $(p,s) \in R(a)$
	\item for each $s \in \Sigma$ there exists a unique sequence of actions in $\Sigma$, $r = s_0,
	s_1, \ldots, s_n = s$ and a sequence of agents $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ such that $s_0 R_{a_1}
	s_1$, $s_1 R_{a_2} s_2$, $\ldots, s_{n-1} R_{a_n} s_n$
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn} \label{forest}
Let $M_T = (\Sigma, R, pre, T)$ be a multi-pointed event model.
$M_T$ is a finite forest event model if
\begin{itemize}
	\item each point $t$ in $T$ is the root of finite tree event model $M^t = (\Sigma^t, R^t,
	pre^t, t)$
	\item for each $M^t$, $\Sigma^t \subseteq \Sigma$
	\item for each $M^t$ and for each $a \in A$, $R^t \subseteq R$
	\item for each $\sigma \in \Sigma^t$, $pre(\sigma) = pre^t(\sigma)$
	\item if $s, t \in T$, then $\Sigma^s$ and $\Sigma^t$ are disjoint
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

TODO: make sure definition of forest and finTree allow for forest to trivially be a finTree

\begin{defn} \label{subtree}
Let $M = (\Sigma, R, pre, r)$ be a finite tree event model.
We say $M' = (\Sigma', R', pre', r')$ is a subtree of $M$ if
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\Sigma' \subseteq \Sigma$
	\item $\forall a \in A \implies R_a' \subseteq R_a$
	\item $\forall \sigma \in \Sigma' \implies pre(\sigma) = pre'(\sigma) $
	\item $M'$ is $R$-generable
	\item there is a sequence of action points in $\Sigma$, $r = s_0, s_1, \ldots, s_n = r'$ and a
	sequence of agents in $A$, $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ such that $s_0 R_{a_1} s_1, s_1 R_{a_2} s_2,
	\ldots s_{n-1} R_{a_n} s_n$
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn} \label{leaf}
Let $M = (\Sigma, R, pre, r)$ be a finite tree event model.
Let $M' = (\Sigma', R', pre', r')$ be a subtree of $M$.
$M'$ is a leaf node of $M$ if $\forall a \in A \implies R'_a = \varnothing$ and $\Sigma' = \{ r'\}$.
\end{defn}

In order to generate these models, we must construct an algebra that can construct event models.
However, we are unaware of any operations that are appropriate for building tree models.
We define an operation to describe a group of agents' belief with regards to the possible execution
of one event model instead of another.

\begin{defn} \label{considers}
Let $M^1$ and $M^2$ be multi-pointed event models, and without loss of
generality let $M^1$ and $M^2$ be disjoint.
Let $B$ be a subset of agents participating in $M^1$ or $M^2$.
We define $M = M^1 \to_B M^2$ as 
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Sigma = \Sigma^1 \cup \Sigma^2$
  \item $R_a = R^1_a \cup R^2_a \text{if } a \notin B$
	\item $R_a =
      R^1_a \cup
      R^2_a \cup
      \{(s,t) | s \in T^1 \land t \in T^2 \}
    \text{if } a \in B $
  \item $pre = pre^1 \cup pre^2$
  \item $T = T^1$
\end{itemize}
The $\to$ operator will be referred to as ``considers".
\end{defn}

$M^1 \to_B M^2$ indicates that if $M^1$ was executed, an agent in $B$ considers $M^2$ as another
possible update.
We also present the disjoint union operator defined by FIXME.

%FIXME: who introduced this? (Baltag and Moss)

\begin{defn} \label{disjoint}
Let $M^1$ and $M^2$ be multi-pointed event models, and without loss of generality let $M^1$ and
$M^2$ be disjoint.
We define $M = M^1 \sqcup M^2$ as
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\Sigma = \Sigma^1 \cup \Sigma^2$
	\item $R_a = R^1_a \cup R^2_a$
	\item $pre = pre^1 \cup pre^2$
	\item $T = T^1 \cup T^2$
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
This is the disjoint union of the two event models, which we can refer to as the agents in $A$
knowing that one of the two models has occurred.
Baltag and Moss call this a non-deterministic choice.
%FIXME: cite

We can use these operations to construct finite tree and forest event models, as we show
in the next section.

\subsection{Completeness}

\begin{lemma}
Suppose $M = (\Sigma, R, pre, r)$ is a finite tree event model.
$M$ can be constructed using insanity event models and $\to$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $M' = (\Sigma', R', pre', r')$ be a subtree of $M$.
We will show by induction that for any $M'$ we can use insanity event models and $\to$ to
construct $M'$.\\
\\
Suppose that $M' = (\Sigma', R', pre', r')$ is a leaf node.
Let $pre'(r') = \phi$, a formula in our logical language.
$M'$ is an insanity event model by definition.
Thus, we can construct $M'$ using insanity event models when $M'$ is a leaf node of $M$.\\
\\
Let $M' = (\Sigma', R', pre', r')$ be an arbitrary subtree of $M$.
Suppose $pre'(r') = \phi$, where $\phi$ is a formula in our logical language.
Let $M^1, M^2, \ldots, M^n$ be all the disjoint subtrees of $M'$.
Suppose that each of $M^1, M^2, \ldots, M^n$ fulfill the induction hypothesis.
Furthermore, let there be agents $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ such that $r' R_{a_1} r^1$, $r' R_{a_2} r^2,
	\ldots, r' R_{a_n} r^n$.\\
\\
Consider the insanity pointed-event model $M^t = (\{ t \}, R^t, pre^t, t)$.
Let $pre^t(t) = \phi$.
Consider the event model $M^K = $
\[
(\ldots((M^t \to_{\{a_1\}} M ^ 1) \to_{\{a_2\}} M_2) \to_{\{a_3\}} \ldots
\to_{\{a_{n-1}\}} M^{n-1} ) \to_{\{a_n\}} M ^ n
\]
We will show that $M^K$ and $M'$ are equivalent event models.\\
\\
Each of $M^1, M^2, \ldots, M^n$ are subtrees of $M'$.
The action points, accessibilities and preconditions in each of $M^1, M^2, \ldots, M^n$ are
equivalent to the action points and the accessibilities and preconditions of those points in $M'$.
We can see that by its definition the ``root" of $M^K$, $t$ has the same precondition as $r'$.
Furthermore, both $r'$ and $t$ can access each of $M^1, M^2, \ldots M^n$ by an $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ edge
respectively.\\
\\
Thus $M'$ and $M^K$ are equivalent.
We can form $M'$ using insanity event models and $\to$, and thus any arbitrary subtree of $M'$
fulfills the induction hypothesis.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Let $M = (\Sigma, R, pre, T)$ be a finite forest event model.
Then $M$ can be constructed using $\to$, $\sqcup$ and insanity event models.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We know that for each $t \in T$ there is a finite tree event model $M^t = (\Sigma^t, R^t, pre^t, t)$
that we can construct using $\to$ and insanity event models.\\
\\
We thus consider the model $M' = \bigsqcup_{t \in T} M^t = (\Sigma', R', pre', T')$.
Since $\Sigma' = \bigsqcup_{t \in T} \Sigma^t$
\end{proof}

\subsection{Achieving information goals}

\begin{lemma}
Let $\phi = \pi \land \cover \Gamma \in \langArbAct$, where $\Gamma = \{\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \ldots,
		\gamma_n\}$ is a finite set.
Suppose that for $\gamma \in \Gamma$ there is a finite forest event model $M^\gamma_T \in \mathcal{AM}$ such that
$\vdash [M^\gamma_{T^\gamma}] \gamma$ and $\vdash \langle M^\gamma_{T^\gamma} \rangle \gamma \iff \exists \gamma$.
Then there exists a finite forest event model $M_T \in \mathcal{AM}$ such that $\vdash [M_T]\phi$ and
$\vdash \langle M_T \rangle \phi \iff \exists \phi$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the insanity model $M'_\sigma \in \insaneClass$ such that $pre(\sigma) =
\exists \pi$ will result in $[M'_\sigma] \pi \iff [M'_\sigma] \phi$.
Now suppose $\Gamma = \{ \gamma_1, \gamma_2, \ldots, \gamma_n \}$.
Let $M_T = ((\ldots((M'_\sigma \to M^{\gamma_1}_{T^{\gamma_1}}) \to
			M^{\gamma_2}_{T^{\gamma_2}}) \to \ldots ) \to M^{\gamma_n}_{T^{\gamma_n}} )$.\\
\\
Our proof is decomposed into three parts.
Firstly, we show that $M_T$ is a finite tree event model and by extension a finite forest event
model.
Secondly, we show that $\vdash [M_T] \phi$.
Lastly, we show $\vdash \langle M_T \rangle \phi \iff \exists \phi$.\\
\\
According to Definition \ref{finTree} $M_T = (\Sigma, R, pre, T)$ is a finite tree event model, the following four conditions must hold:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\Sigma$ is finite \label{treeConFinite}
	\item $T = \{\sigma\}$, where $R \sigma = \varnothing$ \label{treeConRoot}
	\item for each $s \in \Sigma \setminus T$ there is only one $a \in A$ and only one $p \in \Sigma$
	such that $p R_a s$ \label{treeConOneAgent}
	\item for each $s \in \Sigma$ there is a unique finite sequence of points in $\Sigma$, $\sigma =
	s_0, s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k = s$ and a sequence of agents $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$ such that $s_0
	R_{a_1} s_1, s_1 R_{a_2} s_2, \ldots, a_{k-1} R_k
	a_k$ \label{treeConUniquePath}
\end{enumerate}

We note that condition \ref{treeConFinite} is satisfied by the definition of $M_T$ as
\[\Sigma = \{\sigma\} \bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \Sigma^{\gamma}\]
where $\Gamma$ is a finite set and each $\Sigma^\gamma$ is finite.
Therefore, $\Sigma$ itself must also be finite.\\
\\
Condition \ref{treeConRoot} is satisfied by the definition of $M_T$ and the definition of $\to$
(Definition \ref{considers}).
$\to$ only adds relations to $\sigma R$, and $R \sigma$ begins as $\varnothing$.
Thus $\sigma$ is not accessible from any other points.\\
\\
We next show \ref{treeConOneAgent} is satisfied.
Since $A = \{a\}$, all that remains to be shown is that for each $s$ in $\Sigma \setminus T$, there is a unique
$p \in \Sigma$ such that $p R s$.
Let us suppose $s \in \Sigma^\gamma$, for some $\gamma \in \Gamma$.
If $s \in T^\gamma$, then $R s = \{ \sigma \}$ by the definition of $M_T$.
Otherwise, by the definition of $M^\gamma_{T^\gamma}$, any $s \notin T^\gamma$ is in some finite
forest event model and there is some $p \in \Sigma^\gamma$ such that $p R s$.\\
\\
Lastly, we satisfy \ref{treeConUniquePath} with a similar argument to the previous argument.
Suppose $s = \sigma$; the path is trivial.
Now, suppose $s \in \Sigma \setminus \{ \sigma \}$.
Then $s \in \Sigma^\gamma$ for some $\gamma \in \Gamma$.
Then there is a unique path from $s' \in T^\gamma$ to $s$.
Furthermore, $\sigma R s'$, and so there is a unique path from $\sigma$ to $s$.\\
\\
Next, we shall show that $\vdash [M_T] \phi$.
We will show that each of the following holds
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\vdash [ M_T ] \pi$
	\item $\vdash [ M_T ] \Box \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \gamma$
	\item $\vdash [ M_T ] \bigvee_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \Diamond \gamma$
\end{enumerate}

Firstly we show $\vdash [M_T] \pi$.
\begin{align}
	& \vdash \phi \implies \pi \\
	& \vdash \neg \pi \implies \neg \phi \\
	& \vdash \forall (\neg \pi \implies \neg \phi) \\
	& \vdash \forall \neg \pi \implies \forall \neg \phi \\
	& \vdash \neg \forall \neg \phi \implies \neg \forall \neg \pi \\
	& \vdash \exists \phi \implies \exists \pi \\
	& \vdash pre(\sigma) \implies \exists \pi \\
	& \vdash pre(\sigma) \implies \pi \\
	& \vdash [M_\sigma] \pi
\end{align}

Next, we show $\vdash [M_T] \Box \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \gamma$.

\begin{align}
	& \vdash [ M^{\gamma}_{T^{\gamma}} ] \gamma \text{ for every }\gamma \in \Gamma\\
	& \vdash \bigwedge_{v \in T^\gamma} [M^\gamma_v] \gamma \text{ for every }\gamma \in \Gamma\\
	& \vdash \Box \bigwedge_{v \in T^\gamma} [M^\gamma_v] \gamma \text{ for every } \gamma \in \Gamma\\
	& \vdash \bigwedge_{v \in T^\gamma} \Box [M^\gamma_v] \gamma \text{ for every } \gamma \in \Gamma\\
	& \vdash \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \bigwedge_{v \in T^\gamma} \Box [M^\gamma_v] \gamma\\
	& \vdash \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \bigwedge_{v \in T^\gamma} \Box [M^\gamma_v]
	\bigvee_{\gamma' \in \Gamma} \gamma'\\
	& \vdash \bigwedge_{v \in \sigma R} \Box [M^\gamma_v]\bigvee_{\gamma' \in \Gamma} \gamma'\\
	& \vdash pre(\sigma) \implies \bigwedge_{v \in \sigma R} \Box [M_v] \bigvee_{\gamma' \in \Gamma} \gamma'\\
	& \vdash [M_\sigma] \Box \bigvee_{\gamma' \in \Gamma} \gamma'
\end{align}

Finally, we show $\vdash [M_\sigma]\bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \Diamond \gamma$.

\begin{align}
	& \vdash \exists \phi \implies \exists \cover \Gamma\\
	& \vdash \exists \phi \implies \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \Diamond \exists \gamma\\
	& \vdash \exists \phi \implies \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \Diamond \langle
	M^\gamma_{T^{\gamma}} \rangle \gamma\\
	& \vdash \exists \phi \implies \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \Diamond \langle
	\bigvee_{v \in T^\gamma} M^\gamma_{v} \rangle \gamma\\
	& \vdash \exists \phi \implies \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \Diamond \langle
	\bigvee_{v \in \sigma R} M^\gamma_{v} \rangle \gamma\\
	& \vdash \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} (\exists \phi \implies \bigvee_{v \in \sigma R}
	\Diamond \langle M^\gamma_{v} \rangle \gamma)\\
	& \vdash \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} (\exists \phi \implies \langle M^\gamma_{\sigma}
	\rangle \Diamond \gamma)\\
	& \vdash \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} ([M^\gamma_{\sigma}] \Diamond \gamma)
\end{align}

Together, we combine our result to show

\begin{align}
	& \vdash [M_\sigma] \pi \land [M_\sigma] \Box \bigvee_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \gamma \land
	\bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} [M_\sigma] \Diamond \gamma \\
	& \vdash [M_\sigma](\pi \land \cover \Gamma)
\end{align}

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Let $\phi = \alpha \lor \beta \in \langArbAct$.
Suppose that for $\gamma \in \{\alpha, \beta\}$ there is a finite forest event model $M^\gamma_T \in \mathcal{AM}$ such that
$\vdash [M^\gamma_T] \gamma$
and $\vdash \langle M^\gamma \rangle \gamma \iff \exists \gamma$.
Then there exists a finite forest event model $M_T \in \mathcal{AM}$ such that $\vdash [M_T]\phi$ and
$\vdash \langle M_T \rangle \phi \iff \exists \phi$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{thm}
Let $B \subseteq A$, let $\phi \in \langArbAct$ be a finite formula.
Then there exists a finite forest event model $M_T \in \mathcal{AM}$ such that
$\vdash [M_T]\phi$ and $\vdash \langle M_T \rangle \phi \iff \exists \phi$.
\end{thm}

\section{Multi-agent goal achievement in $\langArbAct$}

``Insanity models" are a somewhat cumbersome construct, since their only purpose
is to serve as nodes in the tree.
They have no meaning outside of a tree structure and their semantics are
unintuitive within the context of knowledge or belief.
It would thus be desirable to reduce our atomic models to only group
announcements, since public announcements have more meaning within the context of
knowledge.\\
\\
In order to do so, we must define an operation that ensures that if $M^1$ was to
be executed, a group of agents in $B$ would believe $M^2$ would be executed
instead.
%TODO: Add in the story/motivation --- why is this useful
\begin{defn} \label{possTwo}
Let $M^1$ and $M^2$ be multi-pointed event models, and without loss of
generality let $M^1$ and $M^2$ be disjoint.
Let $B$ be a subset of agents participant in $M^1$ or $M^2$.
We define $M = M^1 \mapsto_B M^2$ as 
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Sigma = \Sigma^1 \cup \Sigma^2$
  \item $R_a =
    R^1_a \cup R^2_a \text{if } a \notin B$
	\item $\sim_a =
      R^1_a \setminus \{(s,t) | s \in T^1 \} \cup
      R^2_a \cup
      \{(s,t) | s \in T^1 \land t \in T^2 \}
    \text{if } a \in B$
  \item $pre = pre^1 \cup pre^2$
  \item $T = T^1$
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

The ``meaning" of $M^1 \mapsto_B M^2$ would be that given a set of actions in
$M^1$ the agents in $B$ believe that one of a set of actions in $M^2$ was
executed instead.\\
\\
It would be desirable to see whether the class of public announcements, with
$\to$ and $\mapsto$ would be sufficient to construct all tree action
models.
Conversely, using insanity and public announcement event models with $\to$ should be sufficient to construct
all tree action models.
\begin{thm}
Suppose $M = (\Sigma, R, pre, r)$ is a finite tree event model.
An event model $M^T \sim M$ can be constructed by public announcements, $\to$ and
$\mapsto$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
We will show by induction that for any subtree of $M$,$M'$, we can construct a pointed event model
$M^s \sim M'$ by public announcements, $\to$ and $\mapsto$.\\
\\
Suppose $M'$ is a leaf node of $M$.
Then $M'$ is composed of a single action point $\sigma$.
Let $pre(\sigma) = \phi$.
Let $M^s$ be of the form $pub(\phi) \mapsto_A pub(\bot)$.
\end{proof}
It is clear that adding disjoint union to either of these sets of operators
allows us to form all forests of tree event models.
It also provides us with an alternate way to form tree event models.\\
\\
%TODO: this isn't true; how to resolve this properly? definition is not sound at the moment
However, we cannot form tree event models with just $\mapsto$.
Consider $M = (\Sigma, R, pre, T)$ such that
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\Sigma = \{\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3, \sigma_4\}$
	\item $R_a =
\{(\sigma_1,\sigma_2),(\sigma_1,\sigma_3),(\sigma_2,\sigma_2),(\sigma_3,\sigma_3)\}$
	\item $R_b = \{(\sigma_1,\sigma_3),(\sigma_1,\sigma_4),(\sigma_3,\sigma_3),(\sigma_4,\sigma_4)\}$
	\item $T = \{ \sigma_1 \}$
pre).
\end{itemize}
We cannot form this model using $ \mapsto $, due to $\sim_a \cap \sim_b \neq
\varnothing$.\\
\\
We can form other interesting models besides trees using these operators.
Let $B$, $C \subseteq A$, the set of all agents.
Suppose $ann(\phi)_B$ is the event model of the group announcement of $\phi$.
We define $skip$ as the public announcement of $\top$ to all agents.
Then $ann(\phi)_B \to_C skip$ models all agents in $B$ learning $\phi$ whilst all agents in $C$
believe that nothing has changed.
Similarly, $skip \mapsto_C ann(\phi)_A$ models the announcement of $\phi$ by an external agent that
the agents in $C$ trust, but the agents in $B$ do not.\\
