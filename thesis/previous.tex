\section{Previous and related work}

% Now comes the time to start citing lots of papers. You do this
% by telling the scientific story, actively mentioning researchers
% by name~\cite{Bloggs, Bill, Barney} in a specific area, and what they
% have done~\cite{Sim}. Other researchers using different approaches can
% also be added~\cite{Smith, Jones}. It is good to try to develop a top-down
% classification of previous work---thus see the sections below.

\subsection{One approach}

% Here we do some more citing~\cite{Wilbur, Jim} and explaining.

\subsection{And another}

% A different approach~\cite{Megg, Lee} is described here.

\subsection{Tying the approaches together}

% A top-down view of the literature is presented, and your own
% work~\cite{Me1, Me2} is placed into context.
