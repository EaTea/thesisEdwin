\section{Introducing Common Knowledge}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What are the limitations of the algebra I have constructed?
	\item motivating examples include group announcements
	\item also cannot do common knowledge
	\item show that as it is sequential execution gives us nothing more
	\item show that we cannot do loops at the moment
	\item attempt to show that by changing atoms to the class of public announcements we might be able
	to construct arbitrary loops using sequences
\end{itemize}
