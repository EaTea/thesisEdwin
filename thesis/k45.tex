\section{Constructing event models in $\mathcal{K}45$ --- fixed by 7th October 2013}

\begin{itemize}
	\item current models not bound by K45 axioms
	\item why do we want to constrain ourselves to K45 models?
	\item what makes K45 difficult?
	\item what do we need to add or change about our current language?
	\item or is the process used to generate models simply different?
	\item what comments can we make about multi-agent K45?
\end{itemize}
