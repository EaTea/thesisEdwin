\section{Results}

Carefully outline each experiment: what was its purpose, and what
precisely did you find? Sometimes it is easiest to display your
results in tabular form, nut note that tables are also floating
environments in \LaTeX\/, so they don't always end up where you want
them to be!

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{A very interesting table of tens.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|} \hline
item1 & 10 & integer \\
item2 & 10.0 & float \\
item3 & `ten' & char \\
item4 & 1010 & binary \\
item5 & $10 + i0$ & complex \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
