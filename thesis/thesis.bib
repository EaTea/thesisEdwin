  abstract = {This
    paper extends
      earlier work
      by its authors
      on formal
      aspects of the
      processes of
      contracting a
      theory to
      eliminate a
      proposition
      and revising a
      theory to
      introduce a
      proposition.
      In the course
      of the earlier
      work,
    Gardenfors
      developed
      general
      postulates of
      a more or less
      equational
      nature for
      such
      processes,
    whilst
      Alchourron and
      Makinson
      studied the
      particular
      case of
      contraction
      functions that
      are maximal,
    in the sense of
      yielding a
      maximal subset
      of the theory
      (or
       alternatively,
       of one of its
       axiomatic
       bases), that
      fails to imply
      the
      proposition
      being
      eliminated. In
      the present
      paper, the
      authors study
      a broader
      class,
    including
      contraction
      functions that
      may be less
      than maximal.
      Specifically,
    they investigate
      "partial meet
      contraction
      functions",
    which are
      defined to
      yield the
      intersection
      of some
      nonempty
      family of
      maximal
      subsets of the
      theory that
      fail to imply
      the
      proposition
      being
      eliminated.
      Basic
      properties of
      these
      functions are
      established:
      it is shown in
      particular
      that they
      satisfy the
      Gardenfors
      postulates,
    and moreover
      that they are
      sufficiently
      general to
      provide a
      representation
      theorem for
      those
      postulates.
      Some special
      classes of
      partial meet
      contraction
      functions,
    notably those
      that are
      "relational"
      and
      "transitively
      relational",
    are studied in
      detail, and
      their
      connections
      with certain
      "supplementary
      postulates" of
      Gardenfors
      investigated,
    with a further
      representation
      theorem
      established.},
