\section*{Background}
%In this section you should give some background to your
%research area. What is the problem you are tackling, and why is it
%worthwhile solving? Who has already done some work in this area,
%and what have they achieved?

\begin {itemize}
  \item What is epistemic logic?
  \item What is a Kripke model?
  \item What is an informative update?
  \item What is an action model?
  \item What are the problems with action models?
\end {itemize}

\section*{Aim}
%Now state explicitly the hypothesis you aim to
%test. Make references to the items listed in the Reference section
%that back up your arguments for why this is a reasonable
%hypothesis to test, for example the work of Knuth~\cite{knuth}.
%Explain what you expect will be accomplished by undertaking this
%particular project.  Moreover, is it likely to have any other
%applications?

\begin{itemize}
  \item Discuss action model updates
  \item Discuss taking an action model that updates many local agents
  \item Outline how we will derive a series of local updates for agents
  \item Outline how we this will be implemented
  \item Outline how we'd like to implement the model
  \item We want to investigate whether this is a feasibly computed model
  \item We want to investigate whether an intermediate specification of updates
    makes action models useful
\end{itemize}
 
\section*{Method}
%In this section you should outline how you intend to go
%about accomplishing the aims you have set in the previous
%section. Try to break your grand aims down into small,
%achievable tasks. Try to estimate how long you will
%spend on each task, and draw up a timetable for each
%sub-task.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item list out different action models, exploring how they update
    different agents (see Baltag and Moss for a similar exercise)
  \item specify a model in $\pi$-calculus to update agents
  \item try and verify model's correctness in replicating action model update
  \item implement model
  \item demonstrate its results with the initially explored action models
  \item test models and find out disadvantages and advantages of models
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Software and Hardware Requirements}
%Outline what your specific requirements will be with regard
%to software and hardware, but note that any special requests
%might need to be approved by your supervisor and the Head of
%Department.

\begin{itemize}
  \item nothing$\ldots$?
\end{itemize}

\section*{Timeline}
%What even the fuck.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item literacy review
  \item 
\end{enumerate}

%Overall, you should aim to produce roughly a two page document
%(and certainly no more than four pages)
%outlining your plan for the year.
