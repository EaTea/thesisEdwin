Project: Executing updates in Epistemic Systems
Supervisor: Assistant Professor Tim French
Informative updates have been used in systems involving multiple actors to
update the state of actors’ knowledge. These updates can be specified using an
action model, which captures the any uncertainty of the outcome of an action. In
a message passing context, such executing an action model update on an agent’s
state of knowledge can be expensive, involving a large expansion of the number
of potentially valid outcomes, followed by a reduction of these states through
constraints on the outcomes and their relationships. Our aim is to implement a
message passing system that explores whether we can reduce the number of
messages needed to execute an action model and assess their practicality in
updating systems of multiple actors.
